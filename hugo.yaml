  # (EXPERIMENTAL) This theme has two options for its CSS styles: "original" and
  # "herman". The former is what you see on Bear Cub's demo (an optimized
  # version of Hugo Bear Blog), while the latter has a more modern look based on
  # Herman Martinus's version of the Blogster Minimal theme for Astro.
